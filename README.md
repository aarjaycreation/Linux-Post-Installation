If you're looking for a minimal Arch Linux install:

My personal dotfiles and post-installation scripts for a new Linux install.
The scripts are made for Debian but can be used on any distro with the inclusion of [Linutil](https://github.com/ChrisTitusTech/linutil). 
The building for DWM should work, as long you install the build dependencies properly from Linutil, if not on Debian.

## Instructions
```
git clone https://github.com/sevu11/Linux-Post-Installation.git
cd Linux-Post-Installation
chmod +x install.sh
./install.sh
```
