Fully automated under 3 minutes >> https://github.com/sevu11/arch-server-script

My personal dotfiles and post-installation scripts for a new Linux install.
The scripts are made for Debian and Arch in mind but should be cross-compatible with any Linux distrubution. 

## Instructions
```
git clone https://github.com/sevu11/Linux-Post-Installation.git
cd Linux-Post-Installation
chmod +x post_install.sh
./post_install.sh
```
